Software for Chess Opening Study Preparation

The software is built on a pre-existing GUI.

The code saves lines you've evaluated, and then

the code tests your remembrance of those lines.

The code can start from any specified ply in the

saved line and test from thereafter.

Use mainly for book preparation or general theory

preparation.
